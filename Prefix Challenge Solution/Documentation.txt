Prefix Evaluation Documentation -

This code is written as the solution to the code eval Prefix Expression challenge.
This code requires a input file , which will be composed of prefixes in each line.
The code takes in each line and evaluate it before iterating to next line.

Code evaluate problem in following manner -

1) Taken one line from the text file.
2) Convert the line to String.
3) Convert String line to String Tokenised format.
4) Iterate through the tokenised input .
5) Check if element is operator or number and update it to corresponding stack.
6) If number stack has more than two numbers than perform the operation over them using 
   operator from operator stack - pop function is used to get the operator and numbers 
   from the stack.
7) Save the result of operation in number list and repeat step 6 , till the expresion
   is fullly consumed.
8) When their is no more operation left to be operated , print the result in a new line.

Using above mentioned steps , the code is evaluating and printing the expression provided
in each line.
